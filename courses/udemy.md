introduction: 1:57:00 (1 hour 57 mins)
good resources like
discord community and online suppor
covers how you can set up flutter in mac os and windows
from the second module itself they have started building projects a quiz app
Taught the dart basics in this module right : 4 hours 53 minutes = 5 hours
This module can be covered within three days
three complete days are more than enough to understand it and to make your own quiz app
covers public private access specifiers stateful stateless widgets as basics
introducing maps (datatype)


Running apps on different devices:  how to set up an emulator, how to set up dart dev tools, what are the significance of dart dev tools (38 mins)
cover in this

state management : build a shop app or
meals app
---------------------------------------------------
working with
user input and forms so this is two
hours four minutes and after this
everything will be done most of the ui
that means you can consider that 60 to
70 percent of the ui will be covered uh
for you to make a real-life app and an
app that you can build on uh that you
can publish on placed on an app store
after this user inputs and forms right
so two or four minutes i think two days
are enough right because forms and input
fields are really easy and the professor
in this lecture in this
course has really explained it very well
even today i'm using uh his code like so
whenever you code you don't need to code
it every time right you can just copy
paste that code so till now also
whenever i need to create a form and
user input field i used his code right
so this is good http request so now here
the backend comes how what is an api so
even if you have worked with express.js
node.js rest apis this will be for you
because now you need to work with apis
so in apis you know that you get a you
create a request you get a response
and you need to handle that response you
get a json data so how you can manage
your json data how you can uh handle
your json data everything will be
covered in this using http package and
yes so pull to refresh so you can see
that whenever you need to
refresh your app you just pull it so
this will be covered in this
so this is good
nine more sections are there so i'm
going to leave the other sections on you
how you can how you want to do it on
yourself i have given you a very good
idea about this course this is a really
good course and you will get a
certificate you can put it on linkedin
you can post it on linkedin
you can put it on your resume it's
totally up to you i guarantee that after
doing those after doing this course you
can make
a chat application an e-commerce
application
or you can say grocery application which
is similar to e-commerce and yeah so i
think that major apps which are there on
uh placed on an app so you can make them
but after some uh practice you can make
any kind of app this course is more than
enough right so after watching this
course you can refer some youtube
tutorials but i think that one course is
really necessary to learn something
uh proficiently right
from basic to advanced one udemy paid
course is really necessary right so this
is it i hope that you like this video if
you want any other road map resources
guidance you can put that in the comment
section and you can follow me on
instagram for more updates till next
content keep coding keep on waiting and
thanks a lot
